//Ad and unbind protection revised
//by _Sitzkrieg in 2018
//------------------------------------------------

//=====I=N=S=T=R=U=C=T=I=O=N=S====

// Adblock for motd, extra protection:
// > Create an empty file in your game directory named textwindow_temp.html
//and make it read-only
//(this prevents the motd from being saved & loaded)
// > Add '127.0.0.1 motd.pinion.gg' to your hosts file.
//This prevents a well known motd advertising network to load


// Protection against server_can_execute bypass
// Make your cfg/config.cfg read-only for extra protection
//If you make it read-only, the server cant bypass the adblocker
